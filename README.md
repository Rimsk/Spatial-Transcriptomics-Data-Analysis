# Spatial-Transcriptomics-Data-Analysis

This repository contains R code for the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. It includes a set of tools and scripts to process, analyze, and visualize spatially-resolved gene expression data. The goal is to offer a comprehensive pipeline for working with spatial transcriptomics datasets, allowing users to explore gene expression patterns within tissue sections while preserving their spatial context.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Code for cleaning, filtering, and normalizing spatial transcriptomics data.
Dimensionality Reduction: Implementations of PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for reducing the dimensionality of gene expression data.
Spatial Visualization: Tools to visualize spatial gene expression patterns, including heatmaps, spatial plots, and feature plots.
Differential Expression: Functions to identify differentially expressed genes across spatial locations within the tissue.
Integration: Methods for integrating data from multiple spatial transcriptomics platforms or across conditions.
Clustering: Clustering of spatial spots or regions to identify distinct gene expression profiles.
Usage:

To run the analysis, clone the repository and install the required R packages. Then, follow the provided examples to load your spatial transcriptomics data and begin the analysis.


Dependencies:

Seurat: For single-cell RNA-seq analysis and spatial data integration.
ggplot2: For creating visualizations.
dplyr: For data manipulation.
spatialLIBD: For spatial transcriptomics specific tasks.
Additional packages like pheatmap, scater, or UMAP may also be used.
Installation:

You can install the required packages by running:

    install.packages(c("Seurat", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "spatialLIBD"))
